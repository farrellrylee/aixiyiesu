So I just got a new CPU, I put it in my Motherboard, and after some drivers, my computer would tell me that my CPU was overheating. I cleaned off the thermal paste I put on it and tried using no thermal paste, then no cooler, but nothing worked. I replaced the CPU with another one which was working just fine. But the same thing happened, I replaced the power supply with a spare one but it still didn't work. I have no idea what is wrong, I read in a couple posts with similar cases that replaci.

I have an issue which has come out of nowhere. Yesterday I moved my PC around the house and all of a sudden my Sapphire 7950 GPU isn't being detected by the computer- not in device manager, not by AMD drivers and not in BIOS. I have tried everything- reseating and cleaning the connectors, changing cables, resetting CMOS on motherboard, reseating every other component, changing power supplies and applying new thermal paste after disassembly. I have narrowed the issue down to the GPU or motherboar.

Hello guys! I need your help I bought a second-hand PC (not from a store, from a friend of mine) and ever since the computer got to my home things got out of control. Every application/game crashes or eventually the computer itself gives me BSOD after short time of using. This seems strange for me since i used that PC at my friend's house many times and it worked perfectly! All the BSOD's are related to ntoskrnl.exe. Link to dump files is here. (https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B7z. I replaced the old parts of my newer computer (PC1) and put them in the older one (PC2). Now PC 2 looks like this : - Win 7 pro 64 bit - RAM : 6GB unknown - Proc : i3 2120 - MB : Asus H61M-K - VC : oldest is HD4830 works fine, the one that doesn't work : club3d HD6870 The problem is best described with a video (https://youtu.be/l-deIDDrQxs) At the end you can see the screen looking for a video output and it can't find anything I have installed the drivers found on the official website. Hello, MSI Afterburner looks like this: As you can see, it appears to know that my graphics card is there and what model it is, along with my driver version, however it's not showing anything like clocks and fan speed. I only noticed this a few days ago when I opened up Afterburner to set my fan speed to auto, which I normally do when I'm about to play a game so that it doesn't stay at 20%. It also shows normal statistics on the right-hand side as well, showing curren. 
So I recently had this problem with my pc, that it just freezes randomly and does not respond to mouse/keyboard. It then turns off after like 5-7 mins and sometimes has problems with booting (just reboots like 3-5 times even before bios splashscreen). This happens on completely random points, like just browsing or watching youtube, it also happened a lot of times when pc was just idle, and it even froze at bios splashscreen and windows loading a couple of times.

I apologise in advance for the following wall of text, however I feel in order to get the best help possible I need to be as in depth as possible. Firstly, the issue is the presence of seemingly apparent random PC crashes. This usually results in my whole computer freezing up for about a 1-2 second. Several times in a week, i've been getting BSODs that occured at any time, but not too frequently that it interrupts most of my work. It's been a recurring problem since the last month and it starts to get on my nerves. I usually get Kernel Security Check Failures and checked BlueScreenView that ntoskrnl.exe is the culprit. I've tried updating my drivers and did a memory test which had no problems, but with no luck eliminating the bluescreen. I'm not sure what else to do and it starts edit: for now, the freezing and shit is gone, no more hiccups, its been booted for good 10 minutes now and by now it would freeze but it didnt after i installed a new driver from the amd site and removed the old one which may or may not have been from windows update. i didnt use a clean install so eh These are the problems i face every day since i switched to win 10. I know some things should be credited to my shit gpu that i accidentally almost melted because it over heated. My specs:. </p>
